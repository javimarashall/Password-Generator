## Summary
This application is used to generate a random password using certain criterias. Upon loading of the application, the user starts it by pressing the "generate password" button. Once the application is started, the user is prompted with a pop up windows asking the user how many characters to use. Next, the user is prompted with several questions asking if the user would like to use upper case letters, lower case letters, numbers or special characters. Depending on what the user selects as the criteria, that's what the application will use to generate the password. 

```
GIVEN I need a new, secure password
WHEN I click the button to generate a password
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
WHEN prompted for character types to include in the password
THEN I choose lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
```
